# Somerville Motor Vechile Crash Report Study

Done in collaboration with [Vaibhavi Laksmi Segu](https://in.linkedin.com/in/vaibhavi-lakshmi-segu-b4982b126) and Yinsheng Koh. We aim to model the crash report data collected from the city of Somerville from 2013-2018 in order to forecast accident rate in the next 2 years. This is to investigate whether this is in accordance to the WSDOT which reported an increase in accident rate by 20% in 2020.
